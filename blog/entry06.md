I overthought everything. When I it was almost my turn to present at the expo I started to get nervous, but when the judges go to me and I started my elevator pitch, I started to feel calm. I got through my whole pitch without any mistakes and without stuttering. After it was over, I told myself that it's fine to be nervous, but if you are prepared then you'll be fine. Altough my pitch was great, I really wish the judges had more time to answer questions. I was one of only a handful of students that didn't make a game for their project because I felt there was no point to make something you couldn't use. 

My in class presentation went a little different. I wasn't nervous, but when I got to one of my slides I forgot what to say. I didn't know what to do so I just skipped the slide. I wish I had slowed down and taken the time to remember what I was planning on saying.

Throughout this time I learned and refined my skill of communication. Communication is important because it can help you speak your mind. You need to have this skill to show off your work. Another skill I developed was time management. When working on my slides for my presentation I knew I would struggle with presenting. Since I realized it would be a problem early on, I decided to take my time with it and work on it every day so I could be as comfortable with it as I could possibly be. 

I am currently on the last step of the Engineering Design Process which is to communicate the results. I did that by presenting in class and by presenting to the judges.

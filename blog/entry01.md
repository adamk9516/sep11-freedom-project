I am currently on step 4 of the Engineering Design Process which is to plan how to solve my issue. Through this time I have learned how to learn things on my own and how to google. Learning something new is always hard but knowing how to find the things that will help you is important. Learning how to google for specific things is very valuable because you don't always know everything. Googling can help you get unstuck from the problems you are facing but it can also just give you an answer that wont benifit your learning at all. I chose the tool of D3.js because my project will consist of visualizing baseball data. D3 allows me to make graphs, plots and other things to visualize my data.

The past week I have learned how to create a dataset. This dataset consists of x and y values to put into a graph.
``` js
const dataset = [
  { date: new Date("2022-01-01"), value: 200 },
  { date: new Date("2022-02-01"), value: 250 },
  { date: new Date("2022-03-01"), value: 180 },
  { date: new Date("2022-04-01"), value: 300 },
  { date: new Date("2022-05-01"), value: 280 },
  { date: new Date("2022-06-01"), value: 220 },
  { date: new Date("2022-07-01"), value: 300 },
  { date: new Date("2022-08-01"), value: 450 },
  { date: new Date("2022-09-01"), value: 280 },
  { date: new Date("2022-10-01"), value: 600 },
  { date: new Date("2022-11-01"), value: 780 },
  { date: new Date("2022-12-01"), value: 320 }
];
```
This dataset is a variable names `dataset` and its x value's are the dates and the y values are the numbers. This graph will show how the values change every month.
